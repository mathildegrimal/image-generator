Use or contribute to our project designed for generating personalized pictures in React.js projects.

This open source project is composed of a front-end in [React.js](https://fr.reactjs.org) and a back-end in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) with express.

**First contributors :**<br/>
Lise Guichard and Antonin Val (front-end developpers) / Virginie Baumes and Mathilde Grimal (back-end developpers)

## Packages

### Frontend
Front uses Typescript, and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com) for layout and components styling.
To send images to the back-end it uses [react-uploady](https://github.com/rpldy/react-uploady), enabling build (client-side) of file-upload features.

### Backend

Node.js back is writen in Javascript, uses [Express], not to mention [Cors](https://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/cors.html) to enable incoming requests from the client.

We use [node-canvas](https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas), a [Cairo](https://cairographics.org)-backed Canvas implementation for Node.js.
